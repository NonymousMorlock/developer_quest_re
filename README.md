Developer Quest Game

## Getting Started

This project is a reinvention of the developer quest game, originally created by 2Dimensions.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [FLUTTER](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [FLARE](https://pub.dev/packages/flare_flutter)

The flare_flutter package is no longer being maintained and has now been migrated to Rive, but this project uses a cleaned version of the now unmaintained flare_flutter package, view the
[online documentation](pub.dev/packages/flare_flutter), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on how to implement it, and a full API reference.
